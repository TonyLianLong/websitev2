I am an EECS PhD student at UC Berkeley and [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Adam Yala](https://www.adamyala.org/) and [Prof. Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/). I am also an intern with the [Deep Imagination Research team](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/) at NVIDIA Research. I hold a B.A. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) during my undergraduate studies. My research primarily focuses on developing multi-modal vision-language models aimed at understanding and generation across text, image, and video data. I also interned with Baiduâ€™s [distributed deep learning team](https://github.com/paddlepaddle/paddle) during my undergraduate years.
