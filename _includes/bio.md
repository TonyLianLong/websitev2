I am an EECS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Adam Yala](https://www.adamyala.org/) and [Prof. Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/). I am also an intern at NVIDIA Research, [Deep Imagination Research team](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/). I completed my B.A. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Stella Yu](https://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/) during my undergraduate studies. My primary research focus involves data-efficient computer vision algorithms that leverage various forms of supervision or even operate without external supervision. I have also gained valuable research experiences as an intern with Baidu's [distributed deep learning](https://github.com/paddlepaddle/paddle) team when I was an undergrad.
