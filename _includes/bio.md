I am a researcher at UC Berkeley under the supervision of [Prof. Stella Yu](https://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/). I obtained my B.A. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am primarily interested in data-efficient computer vision algorithms that leverage various forms of supervision. I was also supervised by [David Anthoff](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-anthoff) and contributed to the [Queryverse](https://www.queryverse.org/) project. I also had research experiences as an intern in Baidu's [distributed deep learning framework](https://github.com/paddlepaddle/paddle) team.
