I am a researcher at UC Berkeley. I am working with [Xudong (Frank) Wang](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xdwang/), under the supervision of [Prof. Stella Yu](https://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/) on Computer Vision projects. My current research interest is data-efficient deep learning algorithms with various forms of supervision. Prior to this, I was supervised by [David Anthoff](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-anthoff) on [Queryverse](https://www.queryverse.org/). I also had experiences as a research intern on Baidu's [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/paddlepaddle/paddle) distributed neural network training platform and as a full-stack software engineering intern with [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com)'s Profile Products team.
