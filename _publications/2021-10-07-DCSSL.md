excerpt: 'We focus on selecting the right data to label for semi-supervised learning without any label or task information and propose a three-step data-centric SSL pipeline. With 8% to 14% improvements, our method demonstrates that a small compute spent on careful labeled data selection brings big annotation efficiency.'

We study unsupervised data selection for semi-supervised learning (SSL), where a large-scale unlabeled data is available and a small subset of data is budgeted for label acquisition. Existing SSL methods focus on learning a model that effectively integrates information from given small labeled data and large unlabeled data, whereas we focus on selecting the right data for SSL without any label or task information, in an also stark contrast to supervised data selection for active learning. Intuitively, instances to be labeled shall collectively have maximum diversity and coverage for downstream tasks, and individually have maximum information propagation utility for SSL. We formalize these concepts in a three-step data-centric SSL method that improves FixMatch in stability and accuracy by 8% on CIFAR-10 (0.08% labeled) and 14% on ImageNet-1K (0.2% labeled). Our work demonstrates that a small compute spent on careful labeled data selection brings big annotation efficiency and model performance gain without changing the learning pipeline. Our completely unsupervised data selection can be easily extended to other weakly supervised learning settings.
